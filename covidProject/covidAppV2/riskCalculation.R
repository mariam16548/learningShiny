  #45% of people under 30 are socializing with people they do not live with and not social distancing
  #around 40% of COVID cases are from people under 30
  #therefore, around 16% of young people (likely asymptomatic) are engaging in risky behavior
  #82% risk reduction when social distancing (https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/health/covid-19-how-much-do-social-distancing-and-masks-reduce-risk)
  #1-(.82*(1-.16))=.31-> 31% risk increase
